## About The Project

This project is a take-home challenge for the FullStack web developer position. In this challenge a news aggregator website has been built that pulls articles from various sources(for example: NewsAPI, The Gurdian and The New York Times) and display them in a clean, easy-to-read format. It has been tried to give it a name and a logo as Nexus and it includes two separate projects:

- **[Nexus Project](https://github.com/rislam169/nexus-project)** The main module of the application
- **[Nexus API](https://github.com/rislam169/nexus-api)** The backend of the application

In order to get more information about the project please go to the [Nexus Project](https://github.com/rislam169/nexus-project#readme), which is the main module of the application.
